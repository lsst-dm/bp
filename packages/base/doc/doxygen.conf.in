# SCons' doxygen support needs the options below to be in the actual doxygen.conf file,
# rather than one included via Doxygen's @INCLUDE option in order for dependencies to
# be generated properly.
#
# The build system will automatically prepend options to specify the project name and
# version number, tagfiles to be generated and used, which outputs to produce,
# and additional configuration files to be included from dependencies (most
# Doxygen options are in the include file provided by the "base" package).
