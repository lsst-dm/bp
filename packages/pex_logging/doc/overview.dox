\section secLogIntro Introduction

The LSST Logging framework allows modules and applications to record
plain text statements about what is happening (including errors,
warnings, status information, and debugging messages) as well as typed
data delivered as named properties.  It allows users to conveniently
tag their messages with a hierarchical label that can indicate where in 
the application the message originates.  Messages sent to a Log can be 
routed to multiple destinations, such as to the terminal screen, to 
a file and to the Event system, all simultaneously.  (Of particular
importance is the ability to send log messages to the LSST Event
System; this allows messages from a multi-process pipeline application
to be collated in arbitrary but orderly ways.)  

The logging framework provides a means to control the number of
messages that appear at a destination (like the screen or a file).
Log messages are tagged with a verbosity or "loudness" level
(representing its relative importance), and Logs are set with
verbosity thresholds.  If a message's verbosity level is less than the
Log's threshold, it will not be recorded.  This allows applications
and modules to selectively turn on and off, say, debugging messages of
which there may be a great number.  Thresholds are implemented to
minimize the impact of unrecorded messages on overall performance, so
debugging messages can remain permanently compiled into the code.
Finally, the different streams that receive log messages can have
their own thresholds set as well; this allows one to, for example,
send more messages to a file than to the screen.

There is a special case of logging that referred to as \e debugging
or \e tracing which is about printing messages that are intended
for display primarily during the debugging stage of development.
There are two APIs for doing this (represented by the Debug and Trace
classes); they behave the same way, though Trace is provided for
backwards compatibility.  These APIs provide an additional mechanism
for filtering out debugging messages at compile time for further
minimization of the impact on the application messages that have been
"turned off".

\subsection secLogHier The Log Hierarchy and Names

The Log class is at the center of the logging framework, representing
an object that can receive messages to potentially print.  A Log is
part of hierarchy of logs; at the top of the hierarchy is the \e root
log.  From any log, so-called \e child log can be created.  Every log
has a hierarchical name associated with it (e.g. "harness.slice").
Periods in the name delimit the levels of the hierarchy (i.e. the more
periods in the name, the lower the log is in the hierarchy).  The root
log typically has an empty string as its name.  The log name is
typically printed out with the message, so the purpose of the
name is to reflect where in the application the message came from.  A
name with more components (i.e. lower in the hierarchy) are meant to
reflect messages from deeper in the application.  

Note that an application can engage multiple, independent Log
hierarchies; however, most applications will simply use one.  One way
an application can share a hierarchy through-out all its various
functions and classes is to pass references to Log instances.  This
method is pretty intrusive as it requires function APIs to accommodate
this.  Thus, for the common simple case of sharing a single Log
hierarchy across an application, the Log framework supports the notion
of a <em>default root log</em>.  A reference to this Log can be
retrieved from anywhere in the application via the static function,
Log::getDefaultLog().  By default, this is Log is configured to simply
send messages to the screen; however, an application should over-ride
this--usually at the start of the application--via a Log class's 
Log::createDefaultLog() static function.  In particular, the
application sets up the destinations, formats, and \ref secLogRec
"default record properties".  For example, the application might
set-up a file to capture messages as well as well as the default
volume threshold.  

\subsection secLogRec LogRecords

A message is sent to its destination for rendering as a LogRecord
representing a single transactional unit.  In fact, a LogRecord can
have any number of messages attached to it.  It can also have any
number of data properties attached to it as well.  (Actually, the
messages and properties are all stored internally to a LogRecord as a
PropertySet.)  LogRecords are usually created from a Log instance;
doing so will usually attach certain standard properties to the
message.  One standard property is the name of the log itself, and
another is the verbosity level of the message.  When the LogRecord is
sent to the Log for rendering, the log will also attach an additional
property giving the timestamp that the message was sent.  For the
simplest messages, it's not necessary to deal with LogRecord instances
explicitly; their creation is hidden behind simple log functions like
Log::log().  

\subsection secLogFmt Log Destinations, Formats, and Preamble

A Log instance can send messages to any number of destinations
automatically, represented by LogDestination objects.  Typically a
destination is the terminal screen (standard error by default) or a
file, but it can also be any other destination, such as the LSST Event
System.  Each destination has an associated LogFormatter; thus, each
destination can be in a different format.  (For example, one may
prefer a more verbose or structured format for a file and a more
brief, readable format for the screen.)  When a new log is created
from a <em>parent log</em>, the new log inherits all the destinations
and formats of its parent.  Additional destinations can then be added
to the new log, if desired, without affecting the behavior of the
parent.  

Recall that a Log instance has an associated verbosity threshold for
filtering out messages that are not "urgent" enough.  In addition to
this filter, each LogDestination has an additional verbosity threshold
associated with it.  This allows one to, for example, send only
informational messages and warnings to the screen while sending all
messages, including debugging messages to a file.  

A Log instance can also be configured with what is called a \em
preamble.  The preamble is a set of properties that will be included
with every LogRecord delivered to the destinations.  At a minimum, this
will include the Log name (with the property name "LOG") and the
verbosity level ("LEVEL").  Applications may add others.  For example,
the LSST Pipeline Harness adds properties such as the host where
the recording process is running, the slide identifier, and the
pipeline run ID.  Also attached to each record is the "TIMESTAMP"
property, which records the time that the record was sent through the
Log.  (This property is not technically a preamble property as its
value is not static.)  

Like destinations, one can add additional preamble properties to a
child log without affecting the parent log.  

\subsection secLogVerb Verbosity and Thresholds

Verbosity levels and verbosity thresholds work together to control the
amount of logging actually recorded.  In particular, every LogRecord
is created with a verbosity level or "volume":  one can think of it as
a measure of the "loudness" of the message or its level of urgency.
It is measured as an integer where higher numbers are louder or more
urgent.  Log objects (as well as LogDestinations; see previous
section) have associated verbosity thresholds--like a signal
barrier--also measured as an integer.  If a record's level is as high
as the Log's threshold or higher, the Log will send the record onto
the destination.  Thus, one can increase the number of messages that
get recorded by lowering the threshold of the log.  

Applications have the ability to set message volumes and thresholds
however desired; however, to provide some consistency across different
modules, the logging framework defines some conventional levels via
static constants defined in the Log class:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Constant Name</th><th>Value</th><th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FATAL</td> <td>20</td>  <td>message reporting a severe,
                                debilitating, or fatal error</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>WARN</td>  <td>10</td>  <td>message reporting abnormal but non-fatal 
                                conditions or behavior</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>INFO</td>  <td>0</td>   <td>message reporting normal behavior</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>DEBUG</td> <td>-10</td> <td>message reporting status that aids in 
                                debugging</td>
</tr>
</table>

These constants can be used to set either a message level or a Log
threshold.  Given this and the above convention, this means that
<em>any message with a negative level is considered a debugging
message</em>.  This fact is used by the default screen formatter
(IndentedFormatter) to indent debugging messages based on the
verbosity level.  

Note that in the debugging interfaces provide via the Debug and Trace
API, verbosity works slightly differently.  Here, the verbosity number
represents how \e unimportant or detailed the message is; that is, the
higher the number provided, the less likely it is to be actually
printed.  As the Debug interface is built on top of Log, the
number is multiplied by -1 to convert it to a verbosity level.
