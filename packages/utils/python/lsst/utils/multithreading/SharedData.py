    """
    @brief a lock-protected container for data that can be shared amongst
    threads.

    This container holds data that is intended to be shared amongst multiple
    threads.  In order to update or (optionally) examine the data, one must
    first aquire the lock associated with the container.

    This container also behaves like a threading.Container, via its 
    wait(), notify(), and notifyAll() functions.  Also like Condition, 
    acquire() is reentrant.  

    SharedData instances may be used with the with statement:

      sd = SharedData()
      with sd:
          sd.blah = 1

    The with statement will acquire the lock and ensure that it is released
    when its block is exited.

        @param needLockOnRead   if true (default), acquiring the lock will 
                      be needed when reading the data.  This is recommended
                      if the data items are anything but primitive types;
                      otherwise, a compound data item (e.g. of type dict)
                      could be updated without acquiring a lock.  
        @param data   a dictionary of data to initialize the container with.
                      This is done by calling initData().  Set this value to
                      False when calling from a subclass constructor; this
                      will allow any non-protected attributes to be set via
                      the subclass's constructor.  If None is given (default),
                      it is assumed that all new attributes will be considered
                      protected data.
