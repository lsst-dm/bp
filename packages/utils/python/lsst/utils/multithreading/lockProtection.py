classes used to protect method from simultaneous access by different
threads.  The primary class is LockProtected.  
"""

SharedLock = threading.RLock

class LockProtected(object):
    """A class that assists in keeping methods thread-safe.

    This class is intended to be enlisted as a base class to the class being
    protected.  A method that is to be protected from simultaneous access 
    would include (at its beginning) a call to _checkLocked():

    class MyClass(BaseClass, LockProtected):
        def __init__(self, lock=SharedLock):
            LockProtected.__init__(self, lock)
            ...

        def dangerous(self):
            self._checkLocked()
            ...

    Doing so will require that the protected class be "locked" before a 
    protected method can be called or else an UnsafeAccessError will be
    raised.  Locking is done via the with statement:

    mc = MyClass()
    with mc:
        mc.dangerous()


    For the locking to work, the protected class must provide to the
    LockProtected constructor a lock object.  Typically this is a
    lsst.utils.multithreading.SharedLock instance or, if one wants to
    employ thread notification techniques, a
    lsst.utils.multithreading.SharedData instance.  It should at least
    be a reentrant lock--that is, having the behavior of threading.RLock
    (from the standard Python Library).

    This class is primarily intended for protecting methods across multiple
    classes together via a single lock.  That is, it can prevent simultaneous
    access to any protected method across multiple class instances.  To
    accomplish this, each class to be protected should accept a lock as
    a constructor argument.  Then the same lock is passed into all of the
    constructors that need protection together.

        @param lock   a reentrant lock instance to use.  If None, the
